	<h3><em> An Introduction to Hochschild Cohomology </em></h3>
	January 29
	<hr>
  One of the first homological techniques to make its way into algebra from topology was that of Hochschild cohomology introduced by Gerhard Hochschild in 1945. It is a cohomology theory designed to record meaningful information about rings and algebras. Many decades later it is still an area of active research and has many applications to other fields of math. In this talk I will first show how one defines/constructs Hochschild cohomology for algebras over a commutative ring. Then, I will go over how to interpret it in low degrees, and we'll look at some applications to commutative algebra.

	<h3><em> All Conics in P^2 are Iso. </em></h3>
	Febraury 5
	<hr>
  More precisely, all irreducible conics in P^2 are iso. The intended audience of this talk is students presently in 953. I will explain what this statement means, how one might think about all of the conics in P^2, and where to find the reducible (degenerate) ones.

	<h3><em> Totally Reflexive Modules and G-dimension </em></h3>
	Febraury 13
	<hr>
   Have you ever thought: p-dim, inj-dim, flat-dim, but I want more? Well, great news because we will be talking about G-dim and (maybe) G-pdim.  This will also get you primed for G-injdim and G-fldim!  G dimensions are refinements of their G-less counterparts and we will talk about both by looking at totally reflexive modules and Gorenstein projective modules.

	<h3> Ana Podariu </h3>
	<h3><em> Using Macaulay Duality to Determine the Strong Lefschetz Property for Artinian Gorenstein Algebras </em></h3>
	Febraury 26
	<hr>
   This is a talk in three parts. In the first, we will (re)introduce the Lefschetz Properties and make some observations about how they interact with Hilbert Functions. In the second section, we introduce the Macaulay Duality in order to categorize Artinian Gorenstein Algebras and make some observations about their nice Hilbert Functions. In the third and last section, we define a Hessian and leverage what we learned about Artinian Gorenstein Algebras and the Lefschetz Properties in the first two sections to make a general statement about whether or not a given Artinian Gorenstein algebra ought to have the Lefschetz Properties.

	<h3><em> Tight is not Solid </em></h3>
	March 5
	<hr>
   Tight closure theory, introduced by Hochster and Huneke in 1988-1990, has been influential in its applications to rings of equal characteristic. In this talk, we will discuss solid closure theory: an attempt by Hochster in 1994 to extend the notion of tight closure to rings in a characteristic-free way (in particular, for rings of mixed characteristic). In this vein, we will examine an example of Roberts from 1994 which shows that solid closure does not agree with tight closure in the equal characteristic zero case. Furthermore, we will briefly discuss an example in mixed characteristic that is part of an ongoing project with Manav Batavia, Vaibhav Pandey, and myself.

	<h3><em> General Principal Symmetric Ideals </em></h3>
	March 12
	<hr>
   Principal symmetric ideals are ideals generated by the orbit of a single polynomial under the action of the symmetric group, where the symmetric group acts on the polynomial ring by permuting variables.  This class of ideals was introduced in a paper by Harada, Seceleanu, and Sega, in which they determined the homological properties of a general principal symmetric ideal when the number of variables in the polynomial ring is sufficiently large.  In this talk, I will discuss some of my recent research on principal symmetric ideals, namely a strengthened version of this result that gives an explicit bound on the number of variables needed in terms of partition numbers.  We will sketch the proof of this result and explore some of the ideas involved.  A key point will be a characterization of principal symmetric ideals, which will also allow us to use Macaulay2 to determine if a symmetric ideal is principal symmetric or not.

	<h3> Nawaj KC </h3>
	<h3><em> Socle Order of a Local Ring </em></h3>
	March 26
	<hr>
   I have recently put a name to an invariant of a local ring, called socle order. Intuitively, this is an invariant of the "derived" socle, or perhaps, a higher-dimensional socle. I will discuss what I know and what I think I know about this invariant. Naturally, I think this is mildly interesting mathematics, and I will try to make my talk completely accessible.

	<h3> Henry Potts-Rubin from the Syracure University </h3>
	<h3><em> DG Algebras & Edge Ideals </em></h3>
	April 2
	<hr>
   I will use DG algebras and edge ideals and new connections between them to introduce the flavor of Combinatorial Commutative Algebra.  This talk is the undergraduate version of the talk I will give in the Commutative Algebra Seminar following CARS.  As such, first-year graduate students are especially encouraged to attend.  I am selfishly using this platform as practice for a job talk I'm giving next week, where the audience is an undergraduate one.  All that said, my hope is that (at the very least) you will take away from this talk possible tips and tricks to use if you ever find yourself in the position of giving a talk on your research to undergraduates.

	<h3><em> Neural Ideals </em></h3>
	April 9
	<hr>
   Today I will share with you some reading I've been doing on neural ideals. I will go through an example of the primary decomposition algorithm and explain how this can be used to obtain the canonical form of a neural ideal. I will also share some neat results about the connection between canonical form and Gr√∂bner bases.

	<h3><em> Acyclic Closures Versus Minimal Models </em></h3>
	April 23

   In this talk, we will construct two semifree differential graded algebras, the acyclic closure and the minimal model.  We then discuss the key differences of each and what that might mean in their applications.
