	<h3><em> Modules of finite length and finite projective dimension </em></h3>
	September 4
	<hr>
  I want to exposit how commutative rings act on finite dimensional vector spaces over a field. Then I will focus on what it means for such actions to be “homologically finite”. Finally, I will present some of the basic open questions about them.

	<h3><em> How commutative algebra can prevent theft </em></h3>
	September 11
	<hr>
  We explore the problem of determining when a sensor network provides complete coverage of a fenced region, using combinatorial commutative algebra, topology, and graph-based models. The sensor network is analyzed through the Rips complex, and coverage is guaranteed when a specific homology class in the relative homology has a non-vanishing boundary. This method applies homological tools to address coverage verification with minimal information about sensor distances, offering a novel approach to ensuring network completeness.

	<h3><em> On a Resolution of Eisenbud and Shamash </em></h3>
	September 18
	<hr>
  This talk will be about a method of constructing a free resolution of a finitely generated module over a quotient ring Q/I where I is generated by a regular sequence. This was first constructed by Jack Shamash in 1969 when I is a principal ideal and then expanded upon by Daivd Eisenbud to the more general case above. When Q is a regular local ring, this resolution can be described with only a finite amount of data, so even though it may be infinite, the structure of it can still be easily described. The downside is that this resolution may not be minimal, but we'll see some examples where it is, as well as a way to check when it will or won't produce a minimal resolution.

	<h3><em> Maximal Cohen-Macaulay Complexes and an Extension to Differential Graded Rings </em></h3>
	September 25
	<hr>
  In commutative algebra, maximal Cohen-Macaulay complexes are a generalization of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay module that you might have heard about in MATH 906. A few years ago, Iyengar, Ma, Schwede, and Walker showed that for a noetherian local ring with a dualizing complex, the existence of a maximal Cohen-Macaualy complex is equivalent to the Canonical Element Theorem. In this talk, I'll sketch out how this is done (along with some background), and I'll talk about the possibility of extending the concept of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay complex over a noetherian local ring to a maximal Cohen-Macaualy DG-module over a DG-ring (a special type of differential graded algebra). If I have time, I'll go over a result that I've found that extends a result obtained by Iyengar, Ma, Schwede, and Walker to differential graded rings.

	<h3><em> An introduction to strong F-regularity </em></h3>
	October 2
	<hr>
  This talk will present an introductory overview of two common types of F-singularities, namely F-splitting and strong F-regularity. We will review all necessary definitions, while proving motivation by stating some theorems relating the Frobenius and strong F-regularity to other properties you may have heard of. We will also get our hands dirty by looking at some examples and proofs of easy facts. This is a pre-talk for today's CAS talk.

	<h3> Ben Katz </h3>
	<h3><em> (partial) Euler Characteristics and Euler Forms </em></h3>
	October 9
	<hr>
  Using homological algebra, Serre defined and studied an intersection multiplicity for finitely generated modules over a regular local ring. He did this by using the Euler characteristic, and showed that it satisfied many properties one would expect with an intersection theory. The goal of this talk is to give an introduction to the partial Euler characteristics and partial Euler forms as well as share some about a project I'm working on involving them.

	<h3><em> Betti tables and Lefschetz properties </em></h3>
	October 16
	<hr>
  For most rings, a lot of the data of the ring can be captured via its (minimal) free resolution. This can then be summarized with a Betti table which, in some sense, describes the complexity of the ring. If such a ring is also Artinian, the ring is said to have the weak Lefschetz property (WLP) if multiplication by some linear form is always full rank. I will go through the background material necessary to be able to understand the follow-up talk in the Commutative Algebra Seminar.

	<h3> Em Stephen </h3>
	<h3><em> Little Cubes: Operads, Spectra, and E_n rings </em></h3>
	October 23
	<hr>
  In this talk I will present an introduction overview of a few topics. First we define operads. An operad is a mathematical object formalizing the idea of a collection of operations parametrized by arity. For instance, there is an associative operad whose algebras are precisely the monoids, and a commutative operad whose algebras are precisely the commutative monoids. Next, we define spectra. Basically, a spectrum is like a topological space in which negative homotopy groups are defined as well as positive ones. The (infinity-)category of spectra is stable in the same sense that the (unbounded) derived (infinity-)category of a ring is, i.e., forming loop spaces is an autoequivalence of the category (like the shift functor on the derived category). Finally, we discuss E_n rings. By formulating appropriate operads, we can define the notion of a ring which is {associative, commutative} not on the nose but only up to coherent homotopy. Considering these internal to a category of chain complexes, we get the notion of A_infinity algebras and E_infinity algebras; considering them internal to the category of spaces, we get the notion of A_infinity or E_infinity ring spaces; considering them internal to the category of spectra, we get the notion of A_infinity or E_infinity, or generally E_n, ring spectra.
